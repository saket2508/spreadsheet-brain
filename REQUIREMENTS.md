# **Superjoin Hiring Assignment ‚Äî Build Semantic Search for Spreadsheets**

## **Context**

At Superjoin, we believe spreadsheets are more than grids of data \- they're documents full of business logic, calculations, and meaning. Users don't think in terms of cell references; they think semantically: *"Where are my profit calculations?"*, *"Show me all customer metrics"*, *"Find efficiency ratios"*.

Your task is to build a **semantic search engine** that understands spreadsheet content conceptually and allows users to find what they're looking for using natural language.

## **The Problem**

### **How Users Actually Think vs. How Spreadsheets Work**

**Users ask semantic questions:**

* *"Find all revenue calculations"*  
* *"Show me cost-related formulas"*  
* *"Where are my margin analyses?"*  
* *"What percentage calculations do I have?"*

**Current tools only support structural queries:**

* Find cells containing "revenue"  
* Show SUM formulas  
* Filter by cell color  
* Search exact text matches

### **Your Challenge**

Build a search engine that bridges this gap \- one that understands what spreadsheet content means, not just what it contains.

## **What You're Building**

A **semantic search system** that can:

1. **Understand Business Concepts**: Recognize that "Q1 Revenue", "First Quarter Sales", and "Jan-Mar Income" all refer to similar concepts  
2. **Interpret Context**: Distinguish between "Marketing Spend" (cost) vs "Marketing ROI" (efficiency metric)  
3. **Find Conceptual Matches**: When someone searches "profitability", find gross margin, net profit, EBITDA calculations  
4. **Handle Natural Language**: Process queries like *"show efficiency metrics"* or *"find budget vs actual comparisons"*

## **Core Features to Build**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Content Understanding**

**Challenge**: Make your system understand what each part of the spreadsheet represents

**Requirements:**

* **Concept Recognition**: Identify business concepts like revenue, costs, margins, ratios, forecasts  
* **Synonym Handling**: Understand "sales" \= "revenue", "profit" \= "earnings", "efficiency" \= "productivity"  
* **Context Interpretation**: Recognize that \=B5/B6 in a "Margin %" column calculates a margin  
* **Formula Semantics**: Understand that SUM formulas in "Total Sales" calculate revenue totals

**Example Semantic Understanding:**

Cell Header: "Gross Profit Margin"  
Formula: \=(Revenue-COGS)/Revenue  
‚Üí Your system should understand: This is a profitability metric, margin calculation, percentage formula

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Natural Language Query Processing**

**Challenge**: Handle business-oriented search queries, not just keyword matching

**Query Types to Support:**

**Conceptual Queries:**

"Find all profitability metrics" ‚Üí Gross margin, net profit, EBITDA, etc.  
"Show cost calculations" ‚Üí COGS, expenses, overhead allocations  
"Where are my growth rates?" ‚Üí YoY%, QoQ%, CAGR formulas  
"Find efficiency ratios" ‚Üí ROI, ROE, asset turnover, etc.

**Functional Queries:**

"Show percentage calculations" ‚Üí All formulas that calculate percentages  
"Find average formulas" ‚Üí AVERAGE, SUM/COUNT combinations  
"What conditional calculations exist?" ‚Üí IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF formulas  
"Show lookup formulas" ‚Üí VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, XLOOKUP

**Comparative Queries:**

"Budget vs actual analysis" ‚Üí Variance calculations, comparison formulas  
"Time series data" ‚Üí Monthly, quarterly, yearly progressions  
"Benchmark comparisons" ‚Üí Ratios against industry standards

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Result Ranking & Output**

**Challenge**: Return the most relevant results with meaningful context, not just cell references

**Ranking Factors:**

* **Semantic Relevance**: How closely does content match the concept?  
* **Context Importance**: Is this a key metric or supporting calculation?  
* **Formula Complexity**: More sophisticated calculations might be more relevant  
* **Data Recency**: Recent data might be more important than historical

**Output Format Requirements:** Your search results should provide **semantic context**, not just cell locations. Design an output format that helps users understand **what they found** and **why it's relevant**.

**Consider Including:**

* **Concept Name**: What business concept this represents  
* **Location**: Where it's found (with human-readable context)  
* **Value/Formula**: Current value and/or underlying calculation  
* **Explanation**: Why this matches the user's query  
* **Business Context**: What role this plays in the spreadsheet

**Example Output Structure for "find margin calculations":**

Gross Profit Margin  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location: 'Revenue Analysis'\!C15  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Formula: \=(Revenue-COGS)/Revenue  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Relevance: Direct margin calculation using standard formula

Operating Margin  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Location: 'P\&L Statement'\!D15:D18  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Relevance: Operating efficiency margins over time

**Result Presentation Options:**

* Structured JSON/objects for programmatic use  
* Human-readable summaries for direct user consumption  
* Grouped results by business concept rather than location

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Sheet Understanding (üç™ Brownie points for this)**

**Challenge**: Understand concepts across multiple spreadsheet tabs

**Requirements:**

* **Cross-Sheet Concept Tracking**: Recognize related concepts across different sheets  
* **Context Switching**: Understand that "Budget" sheet and "Actuals" sheet contain related but different data  
* **Relationship Recognition**: Connect forecasts, budgets, and actuals as related concept families
